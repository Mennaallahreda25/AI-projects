The translated text : 
التوقيت المثالي الصبر في كل الخطط هو الأفضل في بعض الأحيان تكون العملية مؤلمة لا تنسى أن تصلي الظروف بثلاث طرق نعم لأنك تستحقها لا لأنك تستحق أفضل مما يجعلها مثالية ولكنها دائمًا الأفضل ولكن لا تفعل ذلك. لا تنسى التأكد من أنه يفعل شيئًا يغلق الله الأبواب لأنه يعلم أنك تنزل إلى الطابق السفلي لأنك تستحقه لا لأنك تستحق الأفضل.
