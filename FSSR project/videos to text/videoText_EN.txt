The translated text : 
هذا له توقيت مثالي لا يتأخر أبدًا ، لا يتطلب الأمر سوى القليل من الصبر والكثير من الإيمان ، لكن الأمر يستحق الانتظار ، خطط الله هي الأفضل دائمًا في بعض الأحيان تكون العملية مؤلمة وصعبة ولكن لا تنسَ أن تجعل الله صامتًا يفعله شيء يغلق الابواب الله لانك ترى انه يعلم انك لن تتحرك الظروف تجبرك على الله يجيب كل الصلوات بثلاث طرق نعم لانك تستحقها لا لانك تستحق الافضل.
